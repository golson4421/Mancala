Game Rules
There are two players. Each has one side of the board, and they must always start a turn on their side of the board.
Game play always moves counter clockwise. Players pick up all of the stones in the cup they start with. They then move cup-by-cup and put one stone in each cup they pass, including their own points store. The only exception is when they pass their opponent's points store; in that case, they simply skip it.
e.g. Player 2 could start on cup 7 and move to cup 8, 9, 10, etc., and, if they had enough stones, would put one in the [player2 store] when passing it. They could not start a turn on cups 1-6.
